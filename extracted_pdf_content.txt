BIOCHEMISTRY
HbA1c
(NEPHELOMETRY)  
5.4 Glycosylated  Haemoglobin  (HbA1c)
( Specimen:  EDTA  BLOOD)% 4.0 - 6.0   : Non Diabetic
6.1 - 7.0   : Good control
7.1 - 8.0   : Fair control
8.1 - 10.0  : Unsatisfactory
> 10.0      : Poor control
108.3 Estimated  Average  Glucose  (eAG)
( Specimen:  EDTA  BLOOD)mg/dL
Notes:HbA1c  level reflects  the mean  glucose  concentration  over the previous  period  (approximately  6-8 weeks)  and provides  a much  better  
indication  of long term glycemic  control  than blood  and urine glucose  determinations.  The American  Diabetes  Association  recommends  
measurement  of HbA1c  every  3 months  to determine  whether  a patient’s  metabolic  control  has remained  continuously  within  the target  
range.A1C  test should  be performed  at least 2 times  a year in patients  who are meeting  treatment  goals  (and who have stable  glycemic  
control).  A1C test should  be performed  quarterly  in patients  whose  therapy  has changed  or who are not meeting  glycemic  goals.  
Predicting  development  and progression  of diabetic  microvascular  complications.  This assay  is not useful  in determining  day to day 
glucose  control  and should  not be used to replace  routine  blood  glucose  testing.
IMMUNOLOGY
15.7 25 Hydroxy  Vitamin  D3
( Method  : NEPHELOMETRY)
( Specimen:  Serum)ng/ml < 20      : Deficiency
20-29     : Insufficiency
30-100    : Sufficiency
> 100     : Toxicity
Notes:Comments  : Vitamin  D is a fat-soluble  steroid  hormone  precursor  that is mainly  produced  in the skin by exposure  to sunlight.  Vitamin  D is 
biologically  inert and must undergo  two successive  hydroxylations  in the liver and kidney  to become  the biologically  active  1,25 - 
dihydroxyvitamin  D. It is commonly  agreed  that 25-hydroxyvitamin  D is the metabolite  to determine  the overall  vitamin  D status  as it is 
the major  storage  form of vitamin  D in the human  body.  This primary  circulating  form of vitamin  D is present  human  body with levels  
approximately  1000 fold greater  than the circulating  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D. The half-life of circulating  25-hydroxyvitamin  D is 2-3 
weeks.  Vitamin  D is essential  for : Bone health.  In children,  severe  deficiency  leads  to bone-malformation,  known  as rickets.  Milder  
degrees  of insufficiency  are believed  to cause  reduced  efficiency  in the utilization  of dietary  calcium.  Vitamin  D deficiency  causes  : Muscle  
weakness  in elderly,  the risk of falling  has been attributed  to the effect  of vitamin  D on muscle  function.  Vitamin  D deficiency  is a common  
cause  of secondary  hyperparathyroidism.  Elevations  of PTH levels,  especially  in elderly  vitamin  D deficient  adults  can result  in 
osteomalacia,  increased  bone turnover,  reduced  bone mass  and risk of bone fractures.  Low vitamin  D (25-OH) concentrations  are also 
associated  with lower  bone mineral  density.  The results  should  always  be assessed  in conjunction  with the patient’s  medical  history,  
clinical  examination  and other  findings.
