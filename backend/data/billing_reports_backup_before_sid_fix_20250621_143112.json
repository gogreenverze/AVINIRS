Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures.

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",

This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures.

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.

This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",

The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures.

This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",

Vitamin D is biologically inert and must undergo two successive hydroxylations in the liver and kidney to become the biologically active  1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D.  It is commonly agreed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the metabolite to determine the overall vitamin D status as it is the major storage form of vitamin D in the human body. This primary circulating form of vitamin D is present human body with levels approximately 1000 fold greater than the circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The half-life of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2-3 weeks. \n\nVitamin D is essential for : Bone health. In children, severe deficiency leads to bone-malformation, known as rickets. Milder degrees of insufficiency are believed to cause reduced efficiency in the utilization of dietary calcium. \n\nVitamin D deficiency causes : Muscle weakness in elderly, the risk of falling has been attributed to the effect of vitamin D on muscle function. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Elevations of PTH levels, especially in elderly vitamin D deficient adults can result in osteomalacia, increased bone turnover, reduced bone mass and risk of bone fractures. Low vitamin D (25-OH) concentrations are also associated with lower bone mineral density.\n\nThe results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical examination and other findings.",
